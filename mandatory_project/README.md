## Compiling

To compile the serial and the parallel program simple tpye `make -jN`,
where N is the number of threads wanted to utilize.


## Running

The simplest way of running the program is using the `serial_run.sh`,
and the `parallel_run.sh` shell scripts. For the serial one the first
argument given is the number of iterations, while for the
parallel script the first argument is the number of proccess to use
